# Build a NodeJS microservice and deploy it to Kubernetes

### Stack
Weâ€™ll use a simple NodeJS service with a MongoDB for our backend.
- NodeJS 7.5.0
- MongoDB 3.4.2
- Docker 20.10.11

### Microservices

- [Movies Service example](./movies-service)
- [Cinema Catalog Service example](./cinema-catalog-service)
- [Booking Service example](./booking-service)
- [Payment Service example](./payment-service)
- [Notification Service example](./notification-service)
- [API Gateway Service example](./api-gateway)

### How to run the cinema microservice

We need to have docker and kubernetes installed previously.

Please input server.crt and server.key contents in `deploy/kubernetes/configmap/**/*.yaml`

```
$ ./build.sh setup-container-images
$ ./deploy.sh kubernetes apply|delete|diff
```

This will basically create every microservice container image

and deploy every docker service in the swarm.

### TODO

- Persistent Volume for MongoDB
